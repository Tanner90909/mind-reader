# Mind-Reader

This was one of my early projects during my time at Awesome Inc's bootcamp. In this project, we were tasked with learning how to manage state. State was a very difficult concept for me to understand at the time. However the deeper I get into my coding journey, the more I learn about state and what you can do with it. 

I was really proud of this project because it worked! I accomplished exactly what the goal was for this project and demonstrated a very basic understanding of updating and managing state. 

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
